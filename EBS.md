# EBS

### Intro
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction intensive workloads at any scale. 

### EFS
- EFS – Elastic File System
- EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use

### EBS vs EFS – Elastic Block Storage




### EFS – Performance & Storage Classes

- Max I/O – higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)
- Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
- Instance Store provide the best disk performance

### IOPS
Input/output operations per second
