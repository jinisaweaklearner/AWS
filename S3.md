## AWS KMS

- When you use server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts an object before saving it to disk and decrypts it when you download the objects
- With SSE-KMS you let AWS manage the encryption keys but you have full control of the key rotation policy



## Client Side Encryption

With Client Side Encryption you perform the encryption yourself and send the encrypted data to AWS directly. AWS does not know your encryption keys and cannot decrypt your data.



## CORS

- CORS means Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. To learn more about CORS, go here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html





## consistency (eventual consistency)
- you may retrieve the old version of an object updated in a very short time
- you may still retrieve an object deleted in a very short time



## Amazon S3 data consistency model

## S3 Glacier features

Once locked, the policy becomes immutable and Amazon S3 Glacier will enforce the prescribed controls to help achieve your compliance objectives.

## SSE Server Side Encryption

- SSE-S3: AWS manages both data key and master key
- SSE-KMS: AWS manages data key and you manage master key
- SSE-C: You manage both data key and master key



## Route 53

Choosing a routing policy

## S3 pre-signed URL 

A Solutions Architect is designing a new social media application. The application must provide a secure method for uploading profile photos. Each user should be able to upload a profile photo into a shared storage location for one week after their profile is created.
Which approach will meet all of these requirements?

- Use Amazon S3 with the default private access policy and generate pre-signed URLs each time a new site profile is created.

Use pre-signed URL (basically an API) that you can define and set an expiration on and many other parameters for users or entities that don't have AWS credentials to access objects in Amazon S3

All objects and buckets by default are private. The presigned URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions. 



## AWS Storage Gateway

- File Gateway
- Volume Gateway
  - In the cached mode, your primary data is written to S3, while retaining your frequently accessed data locally in a cache for low-latency access.
  - In the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS.
- Tape Gateway

## EFS

Amazon EFS is designed to provide massively `parallel shared access` to `thousands` of Amazon EC2 instances, enabling your applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS with consistent low latencies.


Amazon EFS file systems are distributed across an unconstrained number of storage servers. This distributed data storage design enables file systems to `grow elastically to petabyte scale` and enables massively parallel access from Amazon EC2 instances to your data. The distributed design of Amazon EFS avoids the bottlenecks and constraints inherent to traditional file servers.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html

Amazon EFS provides elastic, shared file storage that is POSIX-compliant. The file system you create supports concurrent read and write access from multiple Amazon EC2 instances and is accessible from all of the Availability Zones in the AWS Region where it is created.

File lock, concurrent access, auto scale = EFS



## Elastic Block Store (EBS)

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction intensive workloads at any scale. 



Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that `persist independently from the life of the instance`. You can create a file system on top of these volumes, or use them in any way you would use a block device (such as a hard drive). You can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.

- RAID 0
  - When I/O performance is more important than fault tolerance (e.g. a heavily used database)

- RAID 1
  - When fault tolerance is more important than I/O performance; for example, as in a critical application.

- Block storage that can be encrypted

## EBS volume types

- General Purpose SSD (gp2)	
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1): high-throughput workloads
- Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): sequential workloads	
- Cold HDD (sc1)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html



- SSD-backed volumes optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write operations **with small I/O size**, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS
- HDD-backed volumes optimized for **large streaming workloads** where throughput (measured in MiB/s) is a better performance measure than IOPS



## EFS vs EBS

Amazon EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EFS provides `a file system interface`, file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking), and `concurrently-accessible storage` for up to `thousands of Amazon EC2 instances`.

Amazon EBS is a `block level` storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EBS can deliver performance for workloads that require the lowest-latency access to data from a `single` EC2 instance.
