# S3

### Naming convention
- No uppercase
- No underscore
- 3-63 characters long
- Not an IP
- Must start with lowercase letter or number


### AWS KMS
- When you use server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts an object before saving it to disk and decrypts it when you download the objects
- With SSE-KMS you let AWS manage the encryption keys but you have full control of the key rotation policy

### Client Side Encryption
With Client Side Encryption you perform the encryption yourself and send the encrypted data to AWS directly. AWS does not know your encryption keys and cannot decrypt your data.



### CORS
- CORS means Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. To learn more about CORS, go here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html



### consistency (eventual consistency)
- you may retrieve the old version of an object updated in a very short time
- you may still retrieve an object deleted in a very short time
