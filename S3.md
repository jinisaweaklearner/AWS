# S3

## Naming convention
- No uppercase
- No underscore
- 3-63 characters long
- Not an IP
- Must start with lowercase letter or number


## AWS KMS
- When you use server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts an object before saving it to disk and decrypts it when you download the objects
- With SSE-KMS you let AWS manage the encryption keys but you have full control of the key rotation policy

### Client Side Encryption
With Client Side Encryption you perform the encryption yourself and send the encrypted data to AWS directly. AWS does not know your encryption keys and cannot decrypt your data.



## CORS
- CORS means Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. To learn more about CORS, go here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html



## consistency (eventual consistency)
- you may retrieve the old version of an object updated in a very short time
- you may still retrieve an object deleted in a very short time


## Amazon S3 data consistency model

## S3 Glacier features
Once locked, the policy becomes immutable and Amazon S3 Glacier will enforce the prescribed controls to help achieve your compliance objectives.

## SSE Server Side Encryption
- SSE-S3: AWS manages both data key and master key
- SSE-KMS: AWS manages data key and you manage master key
- SSE-C: You manage both data key and master key

## S3 pre-signed URL 

A Solutions Architect is designing a new social media application. The application must provide a secure method for uploading profile photos. Each user should be able to upload a profile photo into a shared storage location for one week after their profile is created.
Which approach will meet all of these requirements?

- Use Amazon S3 with the default private access policy and generate pre-signed URLs each time a new site profile is created.

Use pre-signed URL (basically an API) that you can define and set an expiration on and many other parameters for users or entities that don't have AWS credentials to access objects in Amazon S3

All objects and buckets by default are private. The presigned URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions. 

## AWS Storage Gateway
- File Gateway
- Volume Gateway
  - In the cached mode, your primary data is written to S3, while retaining your frequently accessed data locally in a cache for low-latency access.
  - In the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS.
- Tape Gateway

## EFS vs EBS
Amazon EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EFS provides a file system interface, file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking), and concurrently-accessible storage for up to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances.

Amazon EBS is a block level storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EBS can deliver performance for workloads that require the lowest-latency access to data from a single EC2 instance.
